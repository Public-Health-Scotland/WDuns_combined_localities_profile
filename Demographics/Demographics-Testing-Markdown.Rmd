### Deprivation

The following section explores the deprivation structure of `r locality_list[1]` and `r locality_list[2]` through the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD). The SIMD ranks all datazones in Scotland by a number of factors; Access, Crime, Education, Employment, Health, Housing and Income. Based on these ranks, each datazone is then given an overall deprivation rank, which is used to split datazones into Deprivation Quintiles (Quintile 1 being the most deprived, and Quintile 5 the least). The most recent SIMD ranking was carried out in 2020. This section mainly focuses on the SIMD 2020 classifications, however, the 2016 classifications are used to assess how deprivation has changed in `r locality_list[1]` and `r locality_list[2]` when compared to the rest of Scotland.

#### `r locality_list[1]`
Of the `r pop_max_year` population in `r locality_list[1]`, **`r perc_bottom_quintile[[1]]`%** live in the most deprived Quintile (SIMD 1), and **`r perc_top_quintile[[1]]`%** live in the least deprived Quintile (SIMD 5).  

#### `r locality_list[2]`
Of the `r pop_max_year` population in `r locality_list[2]`, **`r perc_bottom_quintile[[2]]`%** live in the most deprived Quintile (SIMD 1), and **`r perc_top_quintile[[2]]`%** live in the least deprived Quintile (SIMD 5).

**Figures `r x` & `r x+1`** present a comparison between the 2016 SIMD ranking applied to 2016 population estimates, and the more recent 2020 SIMD ranking applied to `r pop_max_year` population estimates. The percentages of the population living within each SIMD quintile by domain were calculated using the 2016 and 2020 SIMD datazone classifications respectively. The differences in these percentages are plotted in Figure `r x`. Negative values on the y-axis indicate a decrease in the percent of the population living within a quintile, while positive values indicate an increase in the percent of the population living within a quintile. **Please note that quintiles have been weighted by the Scottish population so, any local changes in SIMD quintile do not necessarily indicate a difference in deprivation, but rather a difference in deprivation in comparison to the rest of Scotland.**
